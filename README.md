## Getting Started
Mustard UI is currently in **BETA**.  Try it out today and help us fine tune the look and feel!

To get started, you can follow our [Installation Guide](https://mustard-ui.com/docs/installation/) or use one of the methods provided below:

**Install Using NPM:**
```bash
npm install mustard-ui
```

**Include via a CDN::**
Either use the latest or a specific version:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/mustard-ui">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/mustard-ui@0.0.5/dist/css/mustard-ui.min.css">
```

**Clone the Repo and Install Dependencies:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kylelogue/mustard-ui.git

```

**Re-build the SCSS files:**
```
npm run build

```

**Open the Sandbox Environment:**
```
npm run dev
```

You can start configuring the colors to suit your needs by first changing the `$brand-color` variable located in `src/scss/base/base.scss` from `$color-green-500` to `$color-indigo-500` or any other color you'd like.  There are lots of colors that can be found in the `src/scss/vars/colors.scss` file.

## CSS Only
Mustard is a CSS framework and does not include any javascript.  We do this in an effort to keep the filesize small.

You can use the framework as is or customize it via the component variables located at the top of each component scss file.
